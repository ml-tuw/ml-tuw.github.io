## Format

In this course, you will experience the role of a typical machine learning researcher.
You will:
* Familiarise yourself with a specific area of machine learning
* Understand and summarise research papers
* Work on a concrete problem/task in machine learning

There are three types of projects:
* **Theoretical**: Formulate proofs, find novel bounds, show the complexity of an algorithm
* **Algorithmic**: Implement an algorithm, perform experiments, achieve good results on data
* **Applied**: Build an application that at its core uses machine learning

---

Working on the project consists of the following steps:

#### 1. Problem statement

Choose a project topic or come up with your own, original idea. Then, write a short problem statement, including your research question, motivation, related work, methodology, and expected results.

#### 2. Working phase

Work on your project and present your work to colleagues and our group. Additionally, you will have discussion meetings with your supervisor if needed. 

#### 3. Final submission

Design a poster and write a short final report to present the results of your work. Your poster will be exhibited to your colleagues and our group during a poster session (snacks included, if Covid allows it!) at the end of the semester.


## Projects (Tentative)

<!-- Here you can find a list of potential projects to choose from:

### Applied & theoretical projects -->

We are happy to supervise machine learning related projects that are connected to our research interests. Examples are:

<!-- ### Competitions & challenges

{% include di_filter.html term="ws2223" projs="competitions" %} -->


### Your own idea!

Describe the scientific merit and novelty of your idea. It is very important to narrow down the rough topic to a tentative research question and approach of interest to us. The research question should not have been answered previously and the answer needs to be verifiable. To answer the question, typically one has to:

* implement some machine learning algorithms and apply them to dataset,
* implement an interesting application that uses machine learning, or
* prove some properties of a learning algorithm.


If you choose your own topic, please briefly describe your project following this structure (check our suggested topics to get an idea):

* Research question
* Suggested Approach
* Related Work
* Context
