## Format

In this course, you will experience the role of a typical machine learning researcher.
You will:
* Familiarise yourself with a specific area of machine learning
* Understand and summarise research papers
* Work on a concrete problem/task in machine learning

There are two types of projects:
* **Applied**: implement and apply an algorithm, perform experiments, achieve good
results on data
* **Theoretical**: formulate proofs, find novel bounds, show the complexity of an algorithm

---

Working on the project consists of the following steps:

##### 1. Problem statement

Choose a project topic or come up with your own, original idea. Then, write a short problem statement, including your research question, motivation, related work, methodology, and expected results.

##### 2. Working phase

Work on your project and present your work to colleagues and our group. Additionally, you will have regular discussion meetings with your supervisor. 

##### 3. Final submission

Write a final report (short or full paper) to present your project, and design a poster. Your poster will be exhibited to your colleagues and our group during a poster session (snacks included, if Covid allows it!) at the end of the semester.

## Topics (Tentative)

Here you can find a list of potential projects to choose from:

#### Applied & theoretical projects

#### Competitions

* [RecSys Challenge 2022](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2022/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

#### Your own idea!

Describe the scientific merit and novelty of your idea. It is very important to narrow down the rough topic to a tentative research question and approach of interest to us. The research question should not have been answered previously and the answer needs to be verifiable. To answer the question, typically one has to:

* implement some machine learning algorithms and apply them to dataset,
* implement an interesting application that uses machine learning, or
* prove some properties of a learning algorithm.
