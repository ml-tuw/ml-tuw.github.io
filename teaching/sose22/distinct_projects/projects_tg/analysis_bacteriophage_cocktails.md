title: Analysis of (Bacteriophage) Cocktails
---

This is an interdisciplinary project jointly with the [Department of Genetics and Genome Biology at the University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/ggb) and the [School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/index.aspx),

**Question**: How can we find the most effective (Bacteriophage) Cocktail?

**Suggested Approach**: Learning with structured data, structured output prediction, constructive machine learning.

**Context**:
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem in many types of bacteria which cause disease (pathogens) in animals and humans. There is an urgent need to find alternatives to antibiotics which are more sustainable. Bacteriophages are viruses which infect and kill bacteria. They are quite specific, only affecting the targeted bacterial species while leaving other bacteria, which may be beneficial, unharmed. Unlike other viruses,
phages do not infect the cells of animals or humans and can be found widely in the environment. We will use machine learning to predict which phage(cocktail)s will infect Salmonella under different conditions.
