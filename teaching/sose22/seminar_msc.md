## Format
This seminar simulates a machine learning conference, where the students take on the role of authors and reviewers. It consists of multiple phases. 

### 1. Proposal phase

Attend the **mandatory** first meeting on 07.03, 15:00 (either in person at **Gußhausstraße 27-29 CA 03 13**, or remotely at **[https://tuwien.zoom.us/my/maxthiessen](https://tuwien.zoom.us/my/maxthiessen)**).

#### Option 1: our suggestions
 > You select **two** projects/papers (i.e., two bullet points) from one of the topics below. You will work with the material mentioned in the overview and the project-specific resources.   

#### Option 2: your own projects
 > You choose **two** different own project ideas to work on. This can be some existing machine learning paper/work or an own creative idea in the context of machine learning. Importantly, it has to be specific and worked out well.

**Independent of the option you chose**, understand the fundamentals of your projects and try to answer the following questions:

- **What** is the problem?
- **Why** is it an interesting problem?
- **How** do you plan to approach the problem? /
**How** have the authors of your project approached the problem?

Select projects and write a short description of them together with the answers to the questions (~3 sentences shoud be sufficient) in **TUWEL**.

We can only accept your own proposals if you can answer the mentioned questions and have a well worked out project idea.

### 2. Bidding and assignment phase
You will also act as reviewers and bid on the projects of your peers you want to review. Based on the biddings, we (in the role as chairs of the conference) will select one of each student's proposals as the actual project you will work on for the rest of this semester. You **do not** need to work on the other project, anymore. Additionally, we will also assign two different projects from other students to you, which you will have to review later in the semester. 

### 3. Working phase
Now the actual work starts. Gather deep understanding of your project, write a first draft of your report and give a 5-minute presentation. We recommend to **go beyond** the given material.

### 4. Reviewing phase
You will again act as a reviewer for the conference by writing two reviews, one for each draft report assigned to you.

### 5. Writing phase
Based on the reviews from your peers (and our feedback) you will further work on your project. 

### 6. Submission phase
Give a final presentation and submit your report.
