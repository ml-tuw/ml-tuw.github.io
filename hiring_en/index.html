The  {{site.data.links.TUWienML_en}} research unit of {{site.data.links.TUWienInformatics}} is looking to hire, as soon as possible, more machine learning researchers.<br><br>


Vienna has repeatedly been named the <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/most-livable-city">most liveable city</a> in the world and the {{site.data.links.InformaticsTUWien}} has consistently been ranked among the top 100 computer science departments in the world. Our group is strongly connected to the European and international machine learning communities. The head of the research unit, {{site.data.people.ThomasGaertner}}, is an editor of the Machine Learning journal, was program co-chair of the largest European conference in the field (ECML PKDD'18), and has been area chair for NeurIPS for a number of years among other <a href="{{'/activities' | prepend: site.data.links.Thomas }}">activities</a>.<br><br>


The {{site.data.links.TUWienMLRU_en}} investigates fundamental machine learning questions and demonstrates the applicability of novel algorithms in real-world applications, often together with colleagues and collaborators from other disciplines such as Chemistry. Challenges that we investigate often involve structured data such as graphs, iterative learning processes such as online/active learning, approximation/convergence guarantees, and computational questions such as the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms. For an overview of some of our research interests, please have a look at previous <a href="{{'/papers' | prepend: site.data.links.Thomas }}">publications</a>. You may also check out <a href="/people">current and previous group members</a>.<br><br>

<h3>Trustworthy Machine Learning</h3>

In the <i>Doctoral College for
Secure and Intelligent Human-Centric
Digital Technologies (<a href="https://secint.visp.wien/">SecInt</a>)</i>
we are looking for multiple PhD students for topics related to machine learning, including the topic <b>Trustworthy Machine Learning</b> (Supervisor: Thomas GÃ¤rtner / Co-Supervisor: Laura Kovacs):<br><br>

Machine Learning is a key-enabling technology. Due to resource or privacy constraints, machine learning is often applied in a distributed fashion. The more (distributed) machine learning algorithms and/or the models learned by them are to be applied in critical applications, the more trustworthy they need to be. For that, (distributed) learning algorithms need to be robust to manipulation of (training) data and communication channels. They also need to guarantee that their models have well-calibrated confidence and are robust to manipulations of (test) data as well.<br><br>

We will systematically investigate attacks on machine learning algorithms as well as their countermeasures. We will first create a taxonomy of attacks and ways to measure the strength of an attack. We will then investigate the robustness to attacks of state-of-the-art (distributed) learning algorithms and devise novel (distributed) learning algorithms provably robust to attacks up to a certain strength. To achieve provable robustness, we will combine the principles underlying the robustness of kernel-based learning algorithms like the support vector machine, the flexibility of feature learning techniques like deep neural networks, novel aggregation mechanisms, and adversarial learning.<br><br>

The objectives of this PhD project are to establish:
<ul>
<li>    Learning algorithms with provable robustness to attacks by training data manipulation</li>
<li>    Distributed learning algorithms with provable robustness to attacks to communication</li>
<li>    Learning algorithms for models with provable robustness to attacks by test data manipulation</li>
</ul>

<b>Application is via the doctoral college (on the <a href="https://jobs.tuwien.ac.at/Job/136572?culture=en">jobs portal</a>) by November, 30th</b>.

<h2><a id="students"></a>Students</h3>
We also have a number of positions and projects available for curiosity-driven highly-motivated students with excellent background in computer science, mathematics, or related fields. Joint degree students are explicitly welcome. <br><br>
Please do not hesitate to express your interest or ask any questions by email to <a href="mailto:caml.tuwien+student@gmail.com?subject=student position">caml.tuwien+student ... gmail.com</a>. If expressing your interest, please include <b>one PDF document</b> containing:
<ul>
<li>cover letter (explaining why you are interested)</li>
<li>CV (including esteem indicators such as THE/QS ranks for your academic institutions)</li>
<li>description of your research interests (can be brief at this stage but would ideally somehow connect to mine)</li>
<li>transcripts of marks (as far as available)</li>
<li>a recent demonstration of your scientific abilities (such as a paper, thesis, or report)</li>
